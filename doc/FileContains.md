# FileContains

Asserts that a file contains some content.  You can either:

- Replace the entire file contents
- Replace some section of the file
- Insert content before some existing content
- Insert content after some existing content

## Arguments

| Name       | Type     | Default | Description                                                                            |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file`     | `string` |         | The file to check the contents of.                                                     |
| `contents` | `string` |         | The content to place in the file.                                                      |
| `position` | `string` |         | The desired position of the `contents`, see below for options with explanations.       |
| `regex`    | `string` |         | The regular expression to match. The meaning of this match is dependent on `position`. |

`contents` can be one of:

- `before` to place the `contents` before the `regex`.  The assert throws if `regex` is not found in the file. If `contents` does not appear before it, then the content is inserted.
- `after` to place the `contents` after the `regex`. The assert thrown if the `regex` is not found in the file. If `contents` does not appear after it then the content is inserted.
- `over` to place the `contents` over the `regex`.  If the content is found, then the assert succeeds, If the `regex` is found the new content replaces it, otherwise the new content is added at the end of the file.
- `all` to replace the contents of the file with `contents`.  If the file already contains `contents` then the assert succeeds, otherwise it fails.

## Example

```json5
{
  assert: "FileContains",
  with: {
    file: "/etc/config",
    position: "over",
    regex: "^#ConfigLine=yes",
    content: "ConfigLine=no",
  }
}
```
